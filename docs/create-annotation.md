You can create annotations to a document in PubAnnotation.
After creating annotations, you can save them to your local disk, or to PubAnnotation.
The latter requires you to be logged in to PubAnnotation.

## Using Editor

1. Go to a document page, or a div page in case of PMC document, of any project in PubAnnotation.
   - for example, [https://pubannotation.org/projects/example/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/25314077](https://pubannotation.org/projects/example/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/25314077)
2. Open the editor. ([TextAE](https://textae.pubannotation.org) is the default editor of PubAnnotation.)

4. Save the annotations.

      - which does not require login
   - or, to PubAnnotation
      - which requires you to be logged in to PubAnnotation.
