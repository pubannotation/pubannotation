You can compare your project to any other project.
For example, you can use this function to evaluate automatically produced annotations, e.g. your project, to manual annotations.

## Using Browser GUI

1. Go to your project page.
   * top > projects > your_project
2. If you are logged in, you will find the _compare_ menu in the pane, _Annotations_<br>
![compare_projects_annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/img/compare_projects.png)
3. Enter the name of an existing project, and click the button.
4. After a while for computation, a link to comparison page will be shown in the _compare_ menu.
