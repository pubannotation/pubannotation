PubAnnotation uses [JSON](https://json.org/) as its default format to store annotations.
This document describes how annotations are represented in JSON in PubAnnotation.

PubAnnotation JSON annotation format supports three different types of information:

* *denotation*,
* *relation*, and
* *modification*.

## Denotations

A denotation connects a span of text to a conceptual object.
In following example, there are two denotation annotations:
{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Following is a visualization of the above annotation, generated by [TextAE](https://textae.pubannotation.org/):

![denotation example]({{ site.url }}/img/ex-denotation.png)

Note that in the visualization, labels are truncated in the end in case of insufficient space.

The example states that there are two denotations, *T1* and *T2*.

* The first one connects *span 0-5* (the text spanning from 0'th to 5th characters) to *Protein*,
* while the second connects *span 42-47* to *Protein*.

The semantic interpreation may vary.
However, the default interpretation of T1 is as follows:

* the text span between the 0'th and the 5'th characters
  * `"span":{"begin":0, "end":5}`
* denotes an entity *T1*
  * `"id":"T1"`
* of which the type is *Protein*.
  * `"obj":"Protein"`


## Relations

A relation connects two entities.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"}
   ],
   "relations": [
      {"id": "R1", "subj": "T1", "pred": "interactWith", "obj": "T2"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

![relation example]({{ site.url }}/img/ex-relation.png)

The example above states that the two entities, *T1* and *T2*, that are introduced by the two denotations,
are related to each other by the predicate, *interactWith*.
Note that the two entities are specified by the two different keys, *subj* and *obj*,
so the relation is directional.
The design is motivated for a better compatibility with [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).

Note that PubAnnotation does not enforce any specific annotation scheme,
e.g., the labels for *obj* in denotations and those for *pred* in relations,
and it is fully up to the producer of annotation
how to design the scheme of his/her annotation.
For example, while the way of annotation in above example may be familiar to the community which seeks informatin on protein-protein interaction, another community, e.g., BioNLP Shared Task, may be more familiar with a finer-grained annotation.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "E1", "span": {"begin": 6, "end": 16}, "obj": "Expression"},
      {"id": "E2", "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 38}, "obj": "Regulation"}
   ],
   "relations": [
      {"id": "R1", "subj": "T1", "pred": "themeOf", "obj": "E1"},
      {"id": "R2", "subj": "E1", "pred": "themeOf", "obj": "E2"},
      {"id": "R3", "subj": "T2", "pred": "causeOf", "obj": "E2"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Modifications

A modification annotation modifies the meaning of denotations and relations, specifically in terms of negation and speculation.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"}
   ],
   "relations": [
      {"id": "R1", "subj": "T1", "pred": "interactWith", "obj": "T2"}
   ],
   "modifications": [
      {"id": "M1", "pred": "Speculation", "obj": "R1"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

![modification example]({{ site.url }}/img/ex-modification.png)

In the above example, the modification annotation, *M1*, states that the relation, *R1*, is speculative rather than declarative.
The annotation may be motivated by the word, *may*, in the sentence.
However, again, PubAnnotation does not enforce any specific annotation scheme, and actual annotation may be performed in a completely different way.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "E1", "span": {"begin": 6, "end": 16}, "obj": "Expression"},
      {"id": "E2", "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 38}, "obj": "Regulation"}
   ],
   "relations": [
      {"id": "R1", "subj": "T1", "pred": "themeOf", "obj": "E1"},
      {"id": "R2", "subj": "E1", "pred": "themeOf", "obj": "E2"},
      {"id": "R3", "subj": "T2", "pred": "causeOf", "obj": "E2"}
   ],
   "modifications": [
      {"id": "M1", "pred": "Speculation", "obj": "E2"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

![modification example 2]({{ site.url }}/img/ex-modification2.png)

In the above example, 
the modification annotation, *M1*, speculates (the existence of) the entity (a regulation event), *E2*,
instead of speculating a relation.

Note that the syntax of modification annotation is experimental and subject to chanage.

What labels to use for *pred* of modification is up to the designer of annotation.
However, currently the visualiztion of [TextAE](https://textae.pubannotation.org/) supports only *Speculation* and *Negation*.

## Multi-layer annotations

Multi-layer annotations - annotations which are made by multiple projects to the same text - can be represented as muptiple tracks.

Usually, you will access annotations within a project, e.g.,

* https://pubannotation.org/__projects/GO-BP__/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/10704529/spans/0-119/annotations.json

In the case, you will get the annotations without tracks:

{% highlight json %}
{
   "target":"https://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/10704529",
   "sourcedb":"PubMed",
   "sourceid":"10704529",
   "text":"Ultrastructural localization of sulfated and unsulfated keratan sulfate in normal and macular corneal dystrophy type I.",
   "project":"GO-BP",
   "denotations":[
      {"id":"T1","span":{"begin":16,"end":28},"obj":"https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0051179"},
      {"id":"T5","span":{"begin":32,"end":40},"obj":"https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0051923"},
      {"id":"T8","span":{"begin":64,"end":71},"obj":"https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0051923"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

However, if you access annotations without indication of a project (or if you specify multiple projects), e.g.,

* https://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/10704529/spans/0-119/annotations.json

then you will get the annotations in multiple tracks:

{% highlight json %}
{
   "target":"https://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/10704529",
   "sourcedb":"PubMed",
   "sourceid":"10704529",
   "text":"Ultrastructural localization of sulfated and unsulfated keratan sulfate in normal and macular corneal dystrophy type I.",
   "tracks":[
      {
         "project":"GO-BP",
         "denotations":[
            {"id":"T1","span":{"begin":16,"end":28},"obj":"https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0051179"},
            {"id":"T5","span":{"begin":32,"end":40},"obj":"https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0051923"},
            {"id":"T8","span":{"begin":64,"end":71},"obj":"https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0051923"}
         ]},
      {
         "project":"GlycoBiology-GDGDB",
         "denotations":[
            {"id":"_T1","span":{"begin":86,"end":116},"obj":"https://acgg.asia/db/diseases/gdgdb?con_ui=CON00391"},
            {"id":"_T2","span":{"begin":86,"end":118},"obj":"https://acgg.asia/db/diseases/gdgdb?con_ui=CON00391"}
         ]
      }
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the difference comes whether a project is specified or not in the URL.


## Discontinuous spans

Sometimes, there may be a case of denotation for which you may want to involve multiple discontinuous spans.
For example, what if you want to annotate _left lung_ in the text, _left or right lung_,
with the ontology id, _UBERON:0002168_.
As the two words are not adjacent to each other, it is not straightforward to specify the span of the denotation.

For representation of discontinuous spans as the span of a denotation, PubAnnotation supports two models:
(1) bagging model, and (2) chaining model.

### Bagging model

In the bagging model, it is allowed to specify the span of a denotation by an array of begin and end offsets, e.g.,

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text":"left and right lung",
   "denotations":[
      {"id":"T2","span":[{"begin":0,"end":4},{"begin":15,"end":19}],"obj":"UBERON:0002168"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The bagging model may be intuitively easy to understand particularly in the JSON representation.
However, it is a kind syntactic sugar which is beyond the normal representation of PubAnnotation.
Internally, it is converted to the chaining model.

Note that in the bagging model, a span may be specified either by just a single pair of begin and end offsets,
or by an array of pairs.
Therefore, for a software program to read a JSON representation of annotation,
it must perform a dynamic type checking, a.k.a. _duck typing_.


### Chaining model (default)

The chaining model uses normal syntax of PubAnnotation JSON format.
Instead, it uses special vocabularly to represent an involvement of multiple discontinuous spans in a denotation.
For example, the above example in the bagging model will be internally converted to the chaining model as below:

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text":"left and right lung",
   "denotations":[
      {"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"_FRAGMENT"},
      {"id":"T2","span":{"begin":15,"end":19},"obj":"UBERON:0002168"}
   ],
   "relations":[
      {"id":"R1","pred":"_lexicallyChainedTo","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

It will be rendered in TextAE as below:

![chaining discontinuous spans example]({{ site.url }}/img/chaining-discontinuous-spans.png)

PubAnnotation uses the chaining model as default.
The JSON representation in the bagging model can be accessed by
setting the parameter _discontinuous_span_ to be the value, _bag_, e.g.,

* https://pubannotation.org/projects/example/docs/sourcedb/@Jin-Dong%20Kim/sourceid/2/annotations.json?__discontinuous_span=bag__
