Once a project is created, and documents are added to the project,
there are three ways to add annotations to the documents.

1. to create annotations manually ([Creating annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/create-annotation/)),
1. to obtain annotations from an annotation server into the project ([Obtaining annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/obtain-annotation/)), and
1. to upload annotations from a local storage to the project ([Submitting annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/submit-annotation/)).
