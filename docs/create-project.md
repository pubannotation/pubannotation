While you can use most of the functionality of PubAnnotation without login,
to maintain your annotation on PubAnnotation, you need to be logged in.

Once you are logged in, you can find a _create_ button in the project listing page ([/projects](https://pubannotation.org/projects))
or your user account page (/users/_your_account_name_).
