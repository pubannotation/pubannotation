## PubAnnotation

* is a **repository** of text annotation, i.e.,
  * anyone can create new annotations or upload existing annotations.
* features an **text alignment** function, a.k.a, blast, thus
  * variation of text can be automatically handled during upload of annotations.
* is a **REST service** through which annotations are publicly accessible in various ways, e.g.,
  * annotations to the same text can be accessed collectively and selectively, even if they are produced by different groups or annotators.
* currently focuses on collecting annotations to **life science literature**:
  * [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) abstracts, and
  * [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) full papers.
