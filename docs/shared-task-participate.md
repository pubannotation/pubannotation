## Shared task participation

A user can participate in shared tasks in following way:

### 1. To find shared tasks
* Up to 10 recently updated shared tasks are listed in the front page of PubAnnotation.
* By clicking the heading _Shared Tasks_, the full list of shared tasks can be accessed.
* Note that, in PubAnnotation, a _shared task_ is a _collection_ which includes multiple _projects_.

### 2. To obtain data sets
* The data set in each project should be downloadable in the _Annotations_ section. Otherwise contact the maintainer of the shared task.

### 3. To submit predicted annotation
1. create a project ([creating annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/create-annotation/)),
1. import texts from a project, either development or evaluation data set, of the shared task ([importing documents]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/import-document/)), and
1. add your predicted annotation to the texts ([adding annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/add-annotation/)).


### 4. To evaluate your prediction
* compare the project with your predicted annotation against the corresponding project, either development or evaluation data set, of the shared task ([comparing projects]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/compare-project/)).

### 5. To make an entry to the task
